YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing

Overview

This project involves harvesting and warehousing YouTube data, utilizing SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit for data collection, storage, and visualization.

Features

- Data Collection: Harvest YouTube channel details, playlists, videos, and comments.
- Storage: Utilize both SQL and MongoDB for storing different types of data.
